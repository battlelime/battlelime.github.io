Hello world! Welcome to the home page of my portfolio! My name is Jesse Tran, I'm a 5th year student at San Jose State University! I'm currently in pursuit of my BFA in DMA at SJSU, to pursue my dreams of one day becoming a full fledge game developer!<br><br>

My porfolio consists of many of my digital art works that I made in my intro Art Classes and as well as a few works that I made outside of school. Most of the works I made in class, they generally had a theme and message towards critiquing enivironmental issues & injustice. Environmental crises were mainly the things on my mind at the time, and I felt a strong urge to reflect my thought and opinions on the topic throught my digital art. I think it was silly move at the time too, since it is pretty ironic in itself to indulge in creating digital art to discuss the issues of real world (at the time Data Centers, Crypto, Digital Art were the main big contributors to the enviromental issues). Going pass my digital art works for school, my personal art projects were more passionate attempts at game dev, while they lack themselves any real meaning or message. They were my first few earnest steps as a beginning developer!<br><br>

P.S. Above is an image of me enjoying a tomahawk steak!<br><br>
