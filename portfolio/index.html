The most important thing I have to do/ achieve in my life is creating and publishing my own video game. Video games has always been a passion of mine since I was a child, in fact, the first memories I have of my life was of me playing video games. And by the time I was in middle school I knew that it was what I wanted to dedicate my life to.<br><br>
I want to work together with other game devs in a company, say, Capcom or Square Enix, to develop a AAA game title. I love the idea of making my own game all by myself too, but I also equally love the thought of working on a big project with hundreds of other people, especially for those big AAA title games like Onimusha, Final Fantasy, or Metal Gear. I'd add that I would also hope I can become a game director one day.<br><br>
I am currently working on creating a indie title game on my own, it's a passion project of mine I've been thinking about since my first year of high school. I'll call it, Dog Sniper.</p>
